Description: Implements the algorithm introduced in Tian, Y., and Safikhani, A. (2024)
    <doi:10.5705/ss.202024.0182>, "Sequential Change Point Detection in High-dimensional 
    Vector Auto-regressive Models". This package provides tools for detecting change points 
    in the transition matrices of VAR models, effectively identifying shifts in temporal 
    and cross-correlations within high-dimensional time series data.
