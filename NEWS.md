# VARcpDetectOnline 0.2.0

* Removed dependency on the `sparsevar` package by incorporating the necessary functions directly.
* Modified `fitVAR` to specifically implement elastic net penalty (`penalty = "ENET"`) and cross validation (`method = "cv"`).
* Changed package license from MIT to GPL-2 because GPL-2 licensed code from the sparsevar package was incorporated.
* Updated documentation and attribution to reflect these changes.




# VARcpDetectOnline 0.1.0

* Initial CRAN submission.
